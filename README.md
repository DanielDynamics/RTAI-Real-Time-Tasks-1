# RTAI-Real-Time-Tasks-1
There are two files that contain strings that need to be collated together into one file. To achieve it, a program that creates three pthreads and a common buffer (a character array) are needed. Two of the pthreads will be used as file readers that read in one line of their file (the first pthread opens and reads first.txt, the second opens and reads second.txt), and save the read line to the common buffer. The third pthread will be used to take information from the common buffer, and store it in a string array that can hold up to 20 strings. After the files have been opened, all pthreads should initialize themselves as real time tasks, and schedule themselves at alternating times so that data can be read in from the files and stored in the array.
